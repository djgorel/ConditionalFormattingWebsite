# What is Conditional Formatting?
Conditional formatting is a formatting technique in Microsoft Excel that allows cells to be automatically formatted in certain ways based on user specified conditions. These conditions are related to the values contained within a spell, such as text, or the numeric range a value is in. For example, you could use conditional formatting to automatically make all cells containing a value over 100 red in a temperature chart. You could also have cells automatically formatted if they contain a specific keyword of interest, when considering non-numerical data.
