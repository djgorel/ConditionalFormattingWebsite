# What is Conditional Formatting?
Conditional formatting is a formatting technique in Microsoft Excel that allows cells to be automatically formatted in certain ways based on user specified conditions. These conditions are related to the values contained within a spell, such as text, or the numeric range a value is in. For example, you could use conditional formatting to automatically make all cells containing a value over 100 red in a temperature chart. You could also have cells automatically formatted if they contain a specific keyword of interest, when considering non-numerical data. 
# Why use Conditional Formatting?
The key use behind conditional formatting is that it allows you to emphasize your data based on the conditions they satisfy, allowing you to quickly diagnose what category a value falls under. Another possible use is that you can give different value ranges in different formats in order to demonstrate trends, such as the temperature between different months. In this scenario, you could use cool colors for cold temperatures, and warmer colors like orange and red for hotter ones, allowing the average temperatures to be quickly grouped just by the format of the cell. Ultimately, it allows the data to be made clearer to the viewer through emphasis.
